# mealDBApp
A simple iOS app that uses https://www.themealdb.com/api.php to fetch meals from the Dessert Category.
For each meal, you can see its' image (if it exists), ingredients, and instructions.

This was made programatically using UIKit.
The root controller is the MainController, where the category is specified and presents accordingly.
